# Drum Kit

This repository contains a simple virtual drum kit implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can play drum sounds by clicking on the corresponding buttons or by pressing keys associated with each drum sound. The kit includes different sounds for 'w', 'a', 's', 'd', 'j', 'k', and 'l' keys, triggering various drum sounds. 

## Usage

To use the drum kit, open the HTML file in a web browser. Click on the buttons to produce sounds or use the associated keys on the keyboard. Each button press triggers both the sound and a visual animation to enhance the user experience.

## Implementation

- HTML structure defines buttons representing different drum sounds.
- JavaScript handles button clicks and key presses to play the corresponding sounds.
- CSS provides styling and visual effects for the drum kit interface.
